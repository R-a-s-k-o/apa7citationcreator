The codes, get input from a excel file called input.

Make sure, your input & output location, check row 39 & 280

Input excel file should have column called INPUT, inputs should be underneath that column.

For website, just copy and paste it to input excel file.

If you cite a pdf file on the website, title of the text should be entered manually.

Code prints the url which includes pdf and asks to enter the title belong to it.

For scientific papers, doi of the paper should be copies. However, doi's format
should be like "/10.1186/s12917-017-0996-5" or "10.1186/s12917-017-0996-5".

For better understanding you can look at the input excel file that I shared.

The code creates a excel file called output which includes your citation.
